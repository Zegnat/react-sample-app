# Refapp React+Typescript work sample excercise for developer applicants

This small repo contains instructions on a small hands-on excercise for candidates applying to a developer position at
[Refapp](https://refapp.com).

## Overall goal
Your task is to create a standalone ReactJS+Typescript web page application with a web server that can be started from the command line.

The functionality of the web page is for the user to be able to submit a block of text and via a simulation of a slow external API receive the number
of characters and words in the text for display.

## Constraints
You must write all code in Typescript, create functional ReactJS components
and use components from the material-ui library instead of builtin html elements.

The simulated external API is provided via an `analysis.ts` source code file.

## What to focus on
The design should be nice but donâ€™t overdo it.
The code should be clean and legible.


## Prerequisites
These are the technologies you need use in order to successfully complete the task:

* npm
* Typescript
* ReactJS
* Material-ui.com (version 4)
